This project is a menu used to order pizza with a various selection of toppings and sizes. The user inputs the information and the program calculates and displays a price for the order.

The classic game of tic-tac-toe. It begins with the user selecting the first square and an X will display. The computer will go next displaying an O in the randomly selected square. The winner is celebrated with music. On the second round, the computer will go first.
